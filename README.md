# BinaryClassificationofInsuranceCrossSelling'
Introduction<br>
This project aims to predict whether a customer will opt for vehicle insurance based on their demographic and vehicle-related data. The problem involves binary classification where the target variable, Response, indicates if a customer is likely to purchase insurance. The dataset includes categorical features (e.g., vehicle type, damage status) and numerical attributes (e.g., age, vehicle age), making it crucial to use robust preprocessing and modeling techniques.

Problem<br>
The main challenges encountered during this project were:

Feature Encoding: Properly encoding categorical variables like Vehicle_Age and Vehicle_Damage was essential to maintain the integrity of information.
Model Optimization: Finding the right hyperparameters for models like XGBoost and LightGBM to balance performance and computational efficiency was a key challenge.
Approach and Solutions
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted analysis of data distributions and correlations to identify trends and outliers.
Data Preprocessing:
Used Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding for categorical features.
Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler for uniform scaling.
Modeling:
Trained multiple models including XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, and LightGBM.
Fine-tuned hyperparameters using RandomizedSearchCV and Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation to optimize performance.
Ensemble Learning: Combined predictions from XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest models to enhance accuracy.
Results<br>
The ensemble model achieved competitive performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining multiple machine learning techniques for binary classification tasks. Let me know if you'd like additional details or refinements! â€‹
